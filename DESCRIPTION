Description: For a sequence of event occurence times, we are interested in
  finding subsequences in it that are too "regular". We define regular as being
  significantly different from a homogeneous Poisson process. The departure from
  the Poisson process is measured using a L1 distance. See Di and Perlman 2007
  for more details.
